# GardenAppBackend

This Spring Boot application is part of a hobby Garden App project done by Henna Niemi. 
It provides backend functionalities for a React UI found at https://github.com/hsniemi/GardenAppFrontend. Try Garden App at http://garden-app.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com.

The aim of the project was to learn about Spring Boot. The application uses the Spring Security framework and JWT for user authentication and authorization. Information sent to the application from the UI is stored in a PostgreSQL database and images of plants are stored in Cloudinary service (https://cloudinary.com/). The application as well as the database are hosted on an Ubuntu server in Amazon Web Services EC2 service.
